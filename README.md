<h4 align="justify"> I am a university student with a passion for mobile app development and a keen interest in staying up-to-date with new technologies. I completed a nine-month Flutter training program at the Google's Game and App Academy. This led me to decide to advance my career in this field. I have developed two applications with Flutter and have also worked on web projects using Flutter. Furthermore, I am delving into Swift with the aim of developing apps for VisionOS in the future. In addition to my independent projects, I also manage two separate startups and actively contribute as a member of their development teams. I prioritize user experience in mobile apps. I've completed Figma courses and constantly strive to improve in this area. I play an active role in various endeavors aimed at advancing the software community.</h4>
